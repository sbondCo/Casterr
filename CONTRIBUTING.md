# Contributing

### :tada: Thanks for looking into Casterr and contributing!

## Finding things to do

- Looking at a our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/sbondCo/projects/8).
- Directly browsing through [issues](https://github.com/sbondCo/Casterr/issues) to find ideas/bugs.
- Searching for creativity! Create your own issue to discuss a feature or, if it's small, just create a pull request.

## The Code

All code is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io). You can format your code by running `npm run prettier:formatall`.

We also use ESLint, you can check for issues by running `npm run lint` or by installing extensions in your editor/ide to allow you to view errors directly in code.

Don't have too much fun now, we know Casterr is an amazing project.
